	<h3><strong>Automation on Company Valuation</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>In a team of two, we manipulated loosely structured data and implemented a program that automatically outputs the excel sheet for a companyâ€™s predicted valuation. Moreover, I researched and studied multiple corporate finance and accounting concepts. This project was written in Python.</p>
		<p>Check out sample inputs: [ <a href="/resource/NVIDIA IS.xlsx">Income Statement</a> ], [ <a href="/resource/NVIDIA BS.xlsx">Balance Sheet</a> ], [ <a href="/resource/NVIDIA CF.xlsx">Cash Flow</a> ], [ <a href="/resource/NVIDIA MKT.xlsx">Market Cap</a> ]</p>
		<p>Check out sample outputs: [ <a href="/resource/output_NVIDIA.xlsx">Nvidia</a> ], [ <a href="/resource/output_ADS.xlsx">Adidas</a> ]</p>

	<h3><strong>Vehicle Detection Using HOG based SVM</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>My team utilized HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients), SVM(Support Vector Machine), Mean Shift Clustering, and Nearest Neighbor to detect vehicles in images and videos. We have gone through a lot of challenges, such as collecting meaningful data, designing algorithm, and tuning parameters. The project was written in Python.</p>

	<h3><strong>Chinese Stock Market Crash and Behavioral Finance</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>In this project, I learned the essential aspects of the financial market and how these aspects interact with each other. The coding part helped with analyzing the Chinese stock market dataset. The project was written in Python.</p>

	<h3><strong>Web Systems: Search Engine Project</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>As the final project of the course Web Systems, I was given the project specification of writing an end-to-end search engine. The search engine has several features including indexing implemented with MapReduce so it can scale to very large corpus sizes, information retrieval based on both tf-idf and PageRank scores, and a new search engine interface with two special features: user-driven scoring and summarization. The project was written using Python, React, Bash script, SQL, and Hadoop, and most of the codes were started from scratch. The website was then deployed to AWS for testing.</p>

	<h3><strong>Personal Website</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>The website you are looking at now is made from scratch. I learned how to write a website using Jekyll and jQuery by reading the docs, which was a fun process to me. I also used knowledge of HTML/CSS that I learned in previous courses.</p>

	<h3><strong>Classifying Lankmarks Using Neural Network</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>As a course project, I was given the dataset with landmark images and labels and I designed a neural network that classifies the test dataset. I experimented with different setups regarding regularization, feature selection, model architecture, hyperparameters, and model evaluation. The project was written in Python.</p>
