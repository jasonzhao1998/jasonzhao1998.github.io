	<h3><strong>Vehicle Detection Using HOG based SVM</strong><button>&#x25B2;</button></h3>
	<div class="project">
		<p>My team utilized HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients), SVM(Support Vector Machine), Mean Shift Clustering, and Neartest Neighbor to detect vehicles in images and videos. We have gone through a lot of challenges, such as collecting meaningful data, designing algorithm, and tuning parameters. The project was written in Python.</p>
