  <p>In my junior year, I have participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), in which I analyzed the Chinese stock market crash using python and some financial knowledge. From my sophomore year, I have also been a director-level member of the Chinese Scholars Student Association (UM-CSSA), where I administered and organized multiple large scale events such as the Chinese New Year Gala 2019, which gathered more than five hundred people from the community.</p>
